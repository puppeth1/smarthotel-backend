I will restart the development server again as requested.

### **Steps:**
1.  **Stop the current server:** Terminate the running `npm run dev` process in Terminal 3.
2.  **Start the server again:** Execute `npm run dev` to launch both the backend and frontend concurrently.

This ensures a fresh restart of the application.
